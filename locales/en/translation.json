    "description": "A beginner in the field of programming and product development, I have a degree in Analysis and System Development (ADS). Since I was young, I have been interested in areas related to art, creativity, and entertainment. I have some knowledge in Photoshop, Illustrator, and Premiere due to my mild curiosity in the field. I worked as a freelance designer for a period of 1-2 years, creating artwork, visual identity, video editing, and web creatives. Since then, I have been trying to combine programming with something I feel good doing."
